0977|THE ARROWHEAD|Located in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains directly above the City of San Bernardino, the arrowhead landmark can be seen for miles around. This important landmark has for centuries been a symbol of the San Bernardino Valley to the Native Indians and then to the pioneers and settlers that followed. It is believed to be a natural landmark. The face of the arrowhead consists of light quartz, supporting a growth of short white sage. This lighter vegetation shows in sharp contrast to the surrounding chaparral and greasewood. Indians who inhabited the San Bernardino Valley believed that the arrowhead pointed the way to the hot mineral springs below, with healing qualities, and thus considered it holy ground. Through the years, numerous forest fires have caused some erosion. But the arrowhead landmark continues to preserve its uniqueness and remains a symbol of the 'pioneer spirit' of the San Bernardino Valley.|N of softball field in Wildwood Park, at intersection of Waterman and 40th St, Hwy 18, San Bernardino|San Bernardino

Explosives were produced here until 1960 and were essential to mining, dam and other construction projects throughout the Western Hemisphere.|Giant and Atlas Rds, Richmond|Contra Costa
1002|SITE OF THE FIRST DYNAMITE FACTORY IN UNITED STATES|The first commercial manufacturing of dynamite in the U.S. occurred in what is now Glen Canyon Park. On March 19, 1868, the Giant Powder Company began production at its first manufacturing plant, under exclusive license from Alfred Nobel to produce his new explosive in America. The factory did not last long. On November 26, 1869, an explosion completely destroyed the entire facility, turning every one of the buildings on the place, and the surrounding fencing, into "hundreds of pieces," according to a newpaper account. The company moved its operations elsewhere, an action that was to be repeated again in the future under similar circumstances, until it moved to its permanent and final home at Point Pinole on San Pablo Bay.|Glen Canyon Park, San Francisco|San Francisco
1003|SITE OF THE WHEATLAND HOP RIOT OF 1913|The Wheatland Hop Riot was one of the most important and well-known events in California labor history. A bloody clash occurred at the Durst Ranch on August 3, 1913, climaxing growing tensions brought about by the difficult conditions farm laborers at the ranch endured. The riot resulted in four deaths and many injuries. It focused public opinion for the first time on the plight of California's agricultural laborers, and resulted in new state legislation to regulate labor camp conditions. A new State Commission on Immigration and Housing was created to help improve working conditions. Beyond that, the Wheatland Hop Riot was the first major farm labor confrontation in California and the harbinger of decades of attempts to organize or control agricultural labor.|Intersection of S 'A' St and 6th St, Wheatland|Yuba
1004|OLD TOWN IRVINE|Old Town Irvine stands today as a testament to the rich agricultural past of what has become one of California's most heavily urban counties. Founded in 1887 as the distribution and storage center of the 125,000-acre Irvine ranch, Old Town Irvine was to develop over the years a bean and grain storage warehouse (1895) and granary (1947) known as the Irvine Bean and Grain Grower's Building, a blacksmith's shop (1916), a hotel (1913), a general store (1911), and an employees' bungalow (1915).

Enoch Pardee's son George also served as Oakland's mayor but is better known as the "Earthquake" Governor of California, holding office from 1903 through 1907. George Pardee was an important Progressive voice in California Republican politics, but his efforts at reform during his governorship brought on the wrath of the railroads and lost him the nomination of his party for a second term. Pardee went on to work for conservationist causes and to help bring Mokelumne River water to Oakland. The Pardee Dam on that river is named after him.|672 11 th Street, Oakland, CA|Alameda
1028|MADONNA OF THE TRAIL|Dedicated in 1929, the Madonna of the Trail is one of twelve identical statues placed in twelve states by the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The statues, differentiated by the inscriptions on their bases, commemorate the westward move of American civilization on a series of trails, which eventually linked the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They especially pay tribute to the importance of a national highway and the role of pioneer women. The statue was designed by German-born architectural sculptor August Leimbach and inspired by a statue of Sacagawea in Portland, Oregon. The Upland monument is said to represent four historic trails: the Mojave Trail, the de Anza Trail, the Emigrant Trail, and the Canyon Road.|1100 Block of North Euclid Avenue, Upland, CA|San Bernardino
1029|USS HORNET|In 1991 the Hornet was designated a National Historic Landmark both for its service in the Pacific in World War II and as the recovery ship for the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 astronauts. Involved in several of the heaviest and most critical battles in the Pacific, the Hornet earned seven battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation. The Hornet or its aircrews were responsible for destroying more than 1400 enemy aircraft. After undergoing modernization the ship was called to service in recovering the landing capsules for the Apollo space program. The Apollo 11 mission was the first landing on the moon. The Hornet, with President Nixon on board, picked up astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin, and Michael Collins from the sea in the summer of 1969, welcoming them to earth from their historic mission. The Hornet recovered the astronauts of Apollo 12 before the carrier was de-commissioned in 1970.|Pier 3 North, Alameda Point, 707 West Hornet Drive, Alameda|Alameda
1030|STAR OF INDIA|The "Star of India," a three-masted bark, is the oldest iron-hulled merchant ship afloat. Built on the Isle of Man, Great Britain, she was launched in 1863 and christened Euterpe . The Trans-Pacific trade from 1871-1898 resulted in the Euterpe circumnavigating the earth twenty-one times, stopping in San Francisco in 1873 and 1883. She was purchased by the Alaska Packers Association to service the salmon canneries in Alaska, leaving each season from Alameda during 1902-1923, Euterpe was renamed Star of India . The Star of India continues to sail the Pacific Ocean as an active reminder of early California's maritime commerce.|Docked at 1306 North Harbor Drive, San Diego|San Diego
1031|FERRYBOAT BERKELEY|The steam ferryboat Berkeley was the first successful West Coast-built and operated ferry to be driven by a screw propeller as opposed to side-wheels. Built by the famous Union Iron Workers of San Francisco in 1898, the ferry operated until 1958 as part of the San Francisco Bay ferry system. The Berkeley is the oldest steel-hulled ferry on the West Coast and the earliest double-ended ferryboat to survive with her original historic fabric intact. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake the Berkeley assisted in evacuating refugees to Oakland.|Docked @ 1306 North Harbor Drive, San Diego|San Diego
1032|RICHMOND SHIPYARDS DISTRICT|The Richmond Shipyards District was once a mammoth facility covering 880 acres in this North Bay community. The yards were constructed for and by the Henry J. Kaiser Company during 1941 and 1942. The San Francisco Bay area became a tremendously important shipbuilding center of the nation during World War II. In 1944 the yards at Richmond were the largest in the world. New methods of ship construction used there, including prefabrication and intense labor specialization, allowed the production of new vessels at a record pace. The techniques used at Richmond became a model for ship yards throughout the nation. During the period 1941-1945 the yards built a total of 747 ships, including 519 Liberty Ships (almost a quarter of the total U.S. production). The social and cultural landscapes of the Bay Area were reshaped by the influx of new workers drawn by good wages for unskilled labor. Between 1941 and 1943 the yards hired 90,000 new workers, many of them women, African Americans from the rural South, and members of other minority groups.|1040 Canal Boulevard, Richmond, CA|Contra Costa
1033|RANCHO NIPOMO (Cpt. William G. Dana Rancho)|Rancho Nipomo, almost 38,000 acres in size, was granted to Boston sea captain William Goodwin Dana, in 1837.

From 1907 to 1916 he wrote three best sellers, including the historical novel, The Winning of Barbara Worth , a chronicle of desert reclamation and the Colorado River flood of 1905. As Wright’s most successful and important book, it brought the Imperial Valley and its agricultural wealth to the attention of the nation. The book’s heroine Barbara Worth became an icon for the region.|East Country Highway 8 &amp; Barbara Worth Road, Holtville, CA|Imperial
1035|Point Arena Light Station|In 1989 the Point Arena Light Station was listed in the National Register of Historic Places for its statewide significance in the area of maritime history. Coastal traffic increased substantially during the 1860s, and heavy storms and fogs often made trips along the coast treacherous. The first buildings at the station were constructed in 1870 and were destroyed in 1906 during the San Francisco Earthquake. At that time the U. S. Lighthouse Service decided to use reinforced concrete in the light house replacement. Prior to this, reinforced concrete had not been employed in the construction of a California lighthouse. Thus, when the Point Arena Lighthouse began operation in 1908, it became the first lighthouse of reinforced concreted in the State. Strikingly situated between the Pacific Ocean to the west and rolling farmland on the east, the Point Arena Light Station retains the character and appearance of one hundred years ago.|Lighthouse Road, Point Arena|Mendocino
1036|Coast Guard Lightship WLV 605 -- Relief (decommissioned)|Lightships were floating lighthouses anchored in areas where it was too deep, expensive, or impractical to construct a lighthouse.

1038|HAY TREE|The Hay Tree is an old, 50 foot high camphor tree standing in the middle of a grassy area in downtown Paramount. The tree is a rare remnant of the city's once thriving dairy and hay industry. The towns of Hynes and Clearwater, which later incorporated to become Paramount, were in the middle of Los Angeles County's extensive region of dairy farms that thrived during the first half of the twentieth century. Hynes-Clearwater was the "Hay Capital" of the world from about 1930 to about 1960. There are no other properties in Paramount that are linked to the hay industry except for this tree.|16475 Paramount Blvd., Paramount|Los Angeles
1039|Sikh Temple Site|The Sikhs-from the Punjab region of India-are an important immigrant group in California since about 1900. Most were drawn to agriculture in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys, since those flat expanses were similar to the Punjab. The 1915 temple was one of the first religious centers for Indians in the United States. A replacement temple was constructed in 1930 and the 1915 building is used as the temple library. The temple helped maintain Punjabi traditions and to establish better understanding of the Sikh people by the community at large. Many events at the temple, and the temple’s charity kitchen, were open to all, regardless of religion or nationality. Stockton’s Sikh Temple is still an important institution for many Sikhs that remain in the region.|1930 S. Grant Street, Stockton|San Joaquin
1040|First Pacific Coast Salmon Cannery Site|From here to the Sacramento River is the approximate site of California’s first Pacific Coast Salmon Cannery in Washington (Broderick), Yolo County, founded by Hapgood, Hume and Company in 1864. This small canning operation was the beginning of the West Coast’s salmon canning industry. Salmon caught in the Sacramento River were canned by the cooker-boiler method, rather than the contemporary salt preservation method of that time. This allowed for wider markets and lower prices. In 1866, due to the decline in salmon runs in the river, the operation was relocated along the Columbia River, Oregon.|Sacramento River, opposite foot of K Street, West Sacramento|Yolo
1041|SITE OF THE CHILDHOOD HOME OF THE BEACH BOYS|It was here at the childhood home of Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson that the three brothers developed their unique musical skills.
