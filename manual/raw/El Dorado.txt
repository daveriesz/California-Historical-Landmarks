He became engaged in the making of ammunition wagons for the Union Army--from that grew his extensive wagon and carriage business and, eventually, the automobile business.
Location: 543 Main St, Placerville

NO. 143 MARSHALL MONUMENT - In 1887 the State of California purchased the site for a monument to commemorate James Marshall, who in 1848 discovered gold near Coloma.
