NO. 1001 CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN CEREMONIAL ROUNDHOUSES (THEMATIC), WASSAMA ROUNDHOUSE - Dating prior to the 1860s, the Wassama Roundhouse was reconstructed in 1985 on the location of the previous four houses. In 1903, the third roundhouse was built using portions of the center pole from the two earlier houses. The roundhouse served as the focal point of spiritual and ceremonial life for many Native Californians. The Wassama Roundhouse continues to serve this purpose.
Location: Wassama Roundhouse State Historic Park, 5.5 mi N of Oakhurst on Hwy 49 to Ahwahnee, then E .4 mi on Round House Rd
