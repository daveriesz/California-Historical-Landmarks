Location: 993 Loring Ave at Ralph Ave, Crockett

NO. 853 CAPTAIN PEDRO FAGES TRAIL - In 1772 Fages, commandante at Monterey, vainly looked for a way across San Francisco Bay. With Franciscan missionary Juan Crespí, 14 soldiers, a muleteer, and an Indian servant, he trekked along Carquinez Strait, thence eastward nearly to Antioch before turning back. These, the first white men to explore what became Contra Costa County, passed this point and camped near Danville on March 31, 1772.
Location: 856 Danville Blvd at El Portal, Danville

NO. 905 MOUNT DIABLO - Mount Diablo had been a home with spiritual significance to the Costanoan Indians for at least 500 years when Spanish explorers viewed the mountain in 1772. In 1851 Mount Diablo was selected as the initial point for land surveys of Northern California and Nevada, with the Mount Diablo Base and Meridian Lines originating at its peak. Due to the mountain's variations in wind, rainfall, and temperature, it is also a preserve for a wide variety of plant and animal life.
Location: Mount Diablo State Park, on summit, 4.5 mi E of ranger station, 14 mi E of Danville, NPS-76000526

NO. 932 MOUNT DIABLO COAL FIELD - This was the largest coal-mining district in California from 1860 to 1914, with five towns-Nortonville, Somersville, Stewartsville, Judsonville, and West Hartley-near twelve major mines. Today the towns are gone, their buildings moved to other communities after the mines closed--the East Bay Regional Park District is preserving mine openings, tailings, railroad beds, and a pioneer cemetery.

NO. 951 LIGHT STATIONS OF CALIFORNIA (THEMATIC), EAST BROTHER LIGHT STATION - East Brother is the oldest wood-frame lighthouse on the West Coast stilll fully operational and still in its historic configuration with functioning equipment. It was one of a group of twelve lighthouses similar but unique in design, built in California during the early 1870's. At the time it was built, it provided both a light and roof signal to guide boats ferrying mail, passengers, and freight between San Francisco and various island ports.
Location: Off Point San Pablo, in Straits of San Pablo, connecting San Francisco and San Pablo Bays

NO. 1002-1 SITE OF GIANT POWDER COMPANY (POINT PINOLE) - Pt. Pinole is the last site of the Giant Powder Company, the first company in America to produce dynamite. Following devastating explosions at their san Francisco and Berkeley sites, the business moved to this isolated location in 1892. Incorporating the established Croatian community of Sobrente, the company town of Giant quickly grew into one of the North Bay's industrial centers. Explosives were produced here until 1960 and were essential to mining, dam and other construction projects throughout the Western Hemisphere.
Location: Giant and Atlas Rds, Richmond

NO. 1032 RICHMOND SHIPYARDS DISTRICT - The Richmond Shipyards District was once a mammoth facility covering 880 acres in this North Bay community. The yards were constructed for and by the Henry J. Kaiser Company during 1941 and 1942. The San Francisco Bay area became a tremendously important shipbuilding center of the nation during World War II. In 1944 the yards at Richmond were the largest in the world. New methods of ship construction used there, including prefabrication and intense labor specialization, allowed the production of new vessels at a record pace. The techniques used at Richmond became a model for ship yards throughout the nation. During the period 1941-1945 the yards built a total of 747 ships, including 519 Liberty Ships (almost a quarter of the total U.S. production). The social and cultural landscapes of the Bay Area were reshaped by the influx of new workers drawn by good wages for unskilled labor. Between 1941 and 1943 the yards hired 90,000 new workers, many of them women, African Americans from the rural South, and members of other minority groups.
Location: 1040 Canal Boulevard, Richmond, CA
