NO. 179 CASTRO-BREEN ADOBE - Also known as "Castro House," the adobe is associated with Jose Castro, Commandant General of Northern California. Castro built the house, which faces the plaza, for his administrative use and for residential use by his secretary. In 1848, the house was purchased with California gold by the Breens, a prominent pioneer family famous as survivors of the ill-fated Donner party of 1846. The Breen family lived in the Castro-Breen adobe for many years.

NO. 180 PLAZA HOTEL - Following use as a dormitory, barracks, and then private residence, the original 1792 one-story adobe was expanded with a timber second story and turned into a hotel in the late 1850s. San Juan Bautista was one of the main stage stops between San Francisco and Los Angeles, and the Plaza Hotel, serving as headquarters for the overland stage, and known for its fine cuisine and liquors, became a favorite stopping place for fiesta guests, traders, and travelers.
